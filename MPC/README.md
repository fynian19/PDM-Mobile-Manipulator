This folder contains all MPC relevant code. Most importantly, MPC.py contains the MPC class as well as other needed functions for running MPC. 


The simulation is then run in mpc_environment.py. Thats where the environment is loaded, settings of the simulation are set, MPC function is called. If you want to change the environment, you can change the name of the environment in line 32 and if you want to change the starting coordinates you can change that in line 56.
